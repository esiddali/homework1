What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A rebase applies divergent commits on top of the main branch. In doing so, it rewrites your development history. A merge however, creates a new commit called a merge commit containing content from the divergent branch and the main branch. A merge does not overwrite your development history the way a rebase does.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a copy of your codebase somewhere other than your local computer.
